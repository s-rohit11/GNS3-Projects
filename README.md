# GNS3 Projects — Network Fundamentals & Analysis

This repository showcases a series of **hands-on network design and analysis projects** built using **GNS3**.  
Each project demonstrates a core networking concept — from basic switching and subnetting to routing, VLANs, NAT, and fault-tolerant design — verified through real device configurations and **Wireshark captures**.

## 📂 Project List

| No. | Project Title | Focus Area |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| 1 | **Network Foundations — Subnetting, VLANs & Packet Capture** | IP addressing, VLANs, ICMP analysis |
| 2 | **Cisco Routers & Basic Routing** | Static routing, gateway configuration |
| 3 | **Static & Dynamic Routing (RIPv2)** | Route propagation, hop validation |
| 4 | **NAT & DHCP Implementation** | Address translation, dynamic IP assignment |
| 5 | **Resilient Network Topologies & Fault Tolerance** | Redundancy, spanning tree, failover |
| 6 | **EIGRP, OSPF & BGP with Failure Simulation** | Advanced routing, protocol convergence |

> All project PDFs include clean topology diagrams, configuration snippets, validation outputs, and packet-capture evidence.
